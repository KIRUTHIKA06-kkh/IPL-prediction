IPL PREDICTIONS USING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS

The given IPL dataset is datacleaned and datapreprocessed for the model training.
Next, the exploratory data analysis are visualized using Data visualization libraries.
Then, the Deep Learning algorithms (Simple regression, LSTM, ANN) are trained by splitting the dataset into tarin and test set.
Finally, the better perfomed model was saved and deployed streamlit application for prediction.

Skills : Python, Pandas, Matplotlip, Seaborn, Tensorflow, Keras, Streamlit.
